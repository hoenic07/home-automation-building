Very futuristic
Energy efficiency, security, optimization
Flexibility: Context Aware:
Flexible modules: Replace whole rules of a house

Energy distubuted integlligent,

Open door concept
Personal assited navigation

-Scenarios and application domains:
	-Smart building, personal assitent navigation, door locking systems (open door), energy saving, Smart city, Automated parking
-Technologies
	-INTERNET, Context Aware Systems. Body scanners
-Feasibility Not all yet. Needs time and standards and companies work together

Security? If this all bases on linux and there is some bug in a low level protocol (SSH), the whole security at the top level does not help.
