## OpenHAB Intro Exercise
The goal is to:
* Control 2 LEDs independently (2 switches)
* and together with a single switch
* Light up a LED with a pushbutton mounted on the breadboard
* Create a timer that switches the LED off after 5 seconds

that can be controlled from the openhab website. The title of this project is **home** therefore the dashboard can be accessed via: http://MyRaspiIP:8080/openhab.app?sitemap=home

Note: All project files have the name of the project as you will see below.

### Basic Setup
A new page consits of a few files, where three of them are important to us and are all placed in the ```openhab/configurations``` folder:

* Sitmap file (```sitmaps/home.sitemap```): Here the UI-Controls of the website will be defined.
* Items file (```items/home.items```): The base file where all LEDs (GPIO ports), sensors and other "devices" are defined. The name used here is the identifier in the other files.
* Rules file (```rules/home.rules```): Rules that have specific triggers (e.g. item state changes) and actions (e.g. switch a LED).

### GPIO Addons
To use the GPIOs with openHAB two add-ons needed to be included in the ```openhab/addons``` folder:

* org.openhab.binding.gpio-*.jar
* org.openhab.io.gpio-*.jar

**Pitfall**: The JARs provided on the *openHAB* website work with the LEDs (mode: output), but somehow have a bug with input GPIOs like the PushButton. Thanks to Konrad Deubler who has found a solution with a newer version of the two JAR-files (version 1.9.0 snapshot instead of 1.8.2). More infos here: https://community.openhab.org/t/raspian-jessie-gpio-input/3448/36

### LED Single
To switch a LED we add the following code to the *home.sitemap*-file that adds a switch control that is bound to the MyLED1 item (same for MyLED2):

    sitemap home label="Home"
    {
     Frame label="LEDs"
     {
       Switch item=MyLED1
       Switch item=MyLED2
     }
    }

and the following code to the *home.items* file:

    Switch MyLED1 "Led 1" { gpio="pin:23 force:yes" }
    Switch MyLED2 "Led 2" { gpio="pin:18 force:yes" }

This definition adds Switches (that can have the values *ON* or *OFF*) that are our LEDs, which are wired on the breadboard. The name in quotes is the displayed name of the item. They are accessed by the GPIO definition. The *force* command ensures that the ports can always be accessed by openHAB (when they where used by the *gpio* command line tool before for example).

When the files are saved openHAB automatically refreshes the configurations and everything should work instantly. Just a refresh of the browser is necessary. When you now switch the LED the debug output of openHAB will give you information about item updates:

### LED GroupSwitch

Add a new switch in the sitemap just like before:

    Switch item=LEDs

Then modify the items-file like this:

    Group  LEDs     "All LEDS"
    Switch MyLED1 "Led 1"   (LEDs)  { gpio="pin:23 force:yes" }
    Switch MyLED2 "Led 2"   (LEDs)  { gpio="pin:18 force:yes" }

At first the group for the LEDs will be defined. Now the group is empty. Therefore we add both LEDs by writing the group name into parenthesis.

**Pitfall**: Write the group BEFORE the GPIO definition. Otherwise it will not work and everything has a strange behaviour.


Now both LEDs switch their states when switching the single group button on the website.
### Push Button

Next we want to light up a LED by pressing a push button on the breadboard via openHAB. Therefore we need to add the button as an item:

    Contact MyButton {gpio="pin:24 activelow:yes force:yes"}

The button is not an output device like the LEDs are. We want to wait for a changing input of the button. Therefore we use *Contact* instead of *Switch* here. *ActiveLow* defines that the *CLOSED* state is when the button is pressed in our case. This is not needed but cleaner.

Now we need to add a rule that triggers the LED change. In the rules file we add the following:

    rule "turn LED on when button press"
    when
            Item MyButton changed
    then
            MyLED1.sendCommand(if(MyLED1.state!=OFF) OFF else ON)
    end

The rule name is just an arbitrary string. *when* defines the trigger, *then* the action. The trigger is relatively straight forward. The action says that the LED state should toggle when the Button changes.
Now the LED goes on and off when the button is pressed and released.

### Timer

First of all we add a new LED item:

    Switch MyTimeLED "5 sec timer LED" {gpio="pin:25 force:yes"}

Next we add a switch to the sitemap file that activtes the LED:

    Switch item=MyTimeLED
    
The most important but happens again in the rules file where we add the following:

    import org.openhab.model.script.actions.Timer
    var Timer timer
    rule "Turn off TimeLED"
    when
            Item MyTimeLED changed to ON
    then
            timer = createTimer(now.plusSeconds(5))[|
              MyTimeLED.sendCommand(OFF)
              timer=null;
            ]
    end

First we import the Timer, then a variable were the Timer will be stored will be added. Next we define the rule that triggers when the LED turns on. The action is to initialize the timer and turn of the LED after 5 seconds. When the newly added switch on the website will be pressed the LED turns on for 5 seconds and switches back to off afterwards.

## Wiring

![Wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoenic07/home-automation-building/master/images/openhab_wiring.jpg)

For the Push Button a 10k ohm resistor was used. For the LEDs 330 ohm resistors were used.
